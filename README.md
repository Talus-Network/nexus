## Overview

Nexus is the onchain Agentic Framework created by [Talus][talus].
The current version, provided here, is a sneak preview of our first iteration. There are
[many ideas](#what-remains-to-be-done) to develop it further but in it's current state it still
showcases what an onchain agentic framework is and it works end-to-end. For more details about
Talus, please visit our [blog][blog] and read our [litepaper][litepaper].

## Architecture

Nexus is built on [Sui Move][sui_move], and consists of several key components:

1. **Onchain logic**: The onchain core logic of Nexus is implemented in Sui Move smart
   contracts in folder [`onchain`][onchain].
2. **SDK**: A Python SDK, in folder [`nexus_sdk`][nexus_sdk], which provides easy-to-use functions for setting up agents, interacting
   with the smart contracts, and running agentic workflows.
3. **Offchain components**: Services that handle LLM inference and anything that runs offchain,
   including supported tools. For more details, please see [`offchain`][offchain], where we
   define two Python packages named `nexus_events` and `nexus_tools`.

The high-level architecture is shown in the following diagram:

    subgraph nexus_tools["<tt>nexus_tools</tt>"]
      LLM_Inference["LLM Inference"]

    end
    nexus_events
  end

  subgraph agent["Example Agent"]
    agent_instructions["Instructions"]
    agent_ui["UI"]
  end

  style agent stroke-dasharray: 5 5, stroke-width:2px;

  nexus_sdk["<tt>nexus_sdk</tt>"]

  nexus_events --> nexus_tools
  nexus_events --> blockchain
  nexus_contracts --> blockchain
  nexus_sdk --> onchain

  agent --> nexus_sdk
```

## What is provided

- Nexus, an onchain agentic framework, made of the components described above.
- [Examples][examples] of agents implemented with Nexus.
- Complete instructions on how to setup a full environment, including the blockchain, smart
  contracts, and the offchain components.

## Looking forward

Our first iteration focused on feasibility, and as an aid in exploring the design space. You
can build agents that work end-to-end. Here are some thoughts, which also give you an idea of
some of the things we are actively working on:

- Develop and experiment with novel **pricing/payment mechanisms**.
- Implement a **slashing mechanism** to penalize misbehaving nodes and maintain network integrity.
- Expand support to include **multiple modalities** beyond LLMs.
- Enable **customization of tool parameters** by both users and agents for greater flexibility.
- Introduce better **error handling** for agent responses to improve reliability.
- Implement **parallel execution** capabilities to enhance task processing efficiency.
- Develop support for **advanced task flow features**, such as loops and backtracking, to handle more complex workflows.
- Provide **offchain storage** options to reduce on-chain data storage needs.
- Introduce **privacy features** to allow for confidential or private data handling.

Stay tuned !

In designing this version of Nexus, we have taken inspiration from [crewAI][crewAI]. Concepts
like 'Tool', 'Task' etc come from there. We also use crewAI tools in the implementation.
